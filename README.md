Dstl has provides us 1km x 1km satellite images in both 3-band and 16-band formats. Our goal is to detect and classify the types of objects found in these regions. 

## 3- and 16-bands images

There are two types of imagery spectral content provided in these image files. The 3-band images are the traditional RGB natural color images. The 16-band images contain spectral information by capturing wider wavelength channels. This multi-band imagery is taken from the multispectral (400 â€“ 1040nm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) (1195-2365nm) range. All images are in GeoTiff format and might require GeoTiff viewers (such as [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/)) to view. Please refer to the [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection/details/data-processing-tutorial) on how to programmatically view the images.

## Object types

In a satellite image, you will find lots of different objects like roads, buildings, vehicles, farms, trees, water ways, etc. We have labeled 10 different classes in Dstl:

 1. Buildings - large building, residential, non-residential, fuel storage facility, fortified building
 2. Misc. Manmade structures 
 3. Road 
 4. Track - poor/dirt/cart track, footpath/trail
 5. Trees - woodland, hedgerows, groups of trees, standalone trees
 6. Crops - contour ploughing/cropland, grain (wheat) crops, row (potatoes, turnips) crops
 7. Waterway 
 8. Standing water
 9. Vehicle Large - large vehicle (e.g. lorry, truck,bus), logistics vehicle
 10. Vehicle Small - small vehicle (car, van), motorbike

Every object class is described in the form of Polygons and MultiPolygons, which are simply a list of polygons. There are two different formats for these shapes: GeoJson and WKT. These are both open source formats for geo-spatial shapes. 

The submission has to be in the WKT format. 

## Geo Coordinates

In this provided dataset, we create a set of geo-coordinates that are in the range of x = [0,1] and y = [-1,0]. These coordinates are transformed such that we can obscure the location of where the satellite images are taken from. The images are from the same region on Earth.

To utilize these images, the grid coordinates are provided of each image so we know how to scale them and align them with the images in pixels. We need the Xmax and Ymin for each image to do the scaling (provided in our grid_sizes.csv) Please refer to this [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection/details/data-processing-tutorial) on how to programmatically view the images.

## File descriptions

*  train_wkt.csv - the WKT format of all the training labels
 * ImageId - ID of the image
 * ClassType - type of objects (1-10)
 * MultipolygonWKT - the labeled area, which is multipolygon geometry represented in WKT format 
*  three_band.zip - the complete dataset of 3-band satellite images. The three bands are in the images with file name = {ImageId}.tif.     MD5 = 7cf7bf17ba3fa3198a401ef67f4ef9b4 
*  sixteen_band.zip - the complete dataset of 16-band satellite images. The 16 bands are distributed in the images with file name =         {ImageId}_{A/M/P}.tif. MD5 = e2949f19a0d1102827fce35117c5f08a
*  grid_sizes.csv - the sizes of grids for all the images
 * ImageId - ID of the image
 * Xmax - maximum X coordinate for the image
 * Ymin - minimum Y coordinate for the image
*  sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
 * ImageId - ID of the image
 * ClassType - type of objects (1-10)
 * MultipolygonWKT - the labeled area, which is multipolygon geometry represented in WKT format
*  train_geojson.zip - the geojson format of all the training labels (essentially these are the same information as train_wkt.csv)
